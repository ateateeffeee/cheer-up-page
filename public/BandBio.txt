<p>&emsp; &ldquo;Heavy The 1975&rdquo;, &ldquo;Happy The Mars Volta&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Weird Paramore&rdquo; are just a few of the labels earned by this 4 piece indie-rock band from Charlotte, North Carolina. &ldquo;Cheer Up!&rdquo; is lead by the songwriting gruesome-twosome, Reno and Andrew Staples. With a new focus on live performance, Joaco Romo Alonso and Ramen have joined on bass and drums respectively.</p>

<p> &emsp; &ldquo;Cheer Up!&rdquo; has been releasing music since 2018 and is gearing up for their second album coming this year. What started as, &ldquo;just another indie band&rdquo; has quickly turned into a more experimental take on the genre, taking inspiration from math rock, hyper pop, and post hardcore but still hanging onto the fun, beachy vibe.</p>
